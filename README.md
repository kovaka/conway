# conway
Play conway's game of life in your terminal

Type in
```
$ ./run.py
```
at your terminal to start it

Also, in the boards directory are a few pattern files that you can try out. You will have to switch out the name of the file in run.py to use a different file.

Commandline arguments coming soon
